This vignette will introduce the concept of **marginal means**.

# Raw Means

The [`iris`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) dataset,
available in base `R`, contains observations of 3 types of *iris* flowers (the
`Species` variable); *Setosa*, *Versicolor* and *Virginica*, for which different
features were measured, such as the length and width of the sepals and petals.

A traditional starting point, when reporting such data, is to start by
descriptive statistics. For instance, **what is the mean `Sepal.Width` for each
of the 3 species**.

We can compute the means very easily by grouping the observations by species,
and then computing the mean and the SD:

```{r}
library(poorman)

iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_Sepal.Width = mean(Sepal.Width),
    SD_Sepal.Width = sd(Sepal.Width)
  )
```

We can also provide a plot:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(see)

ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width, fill = Species)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_jitter2(width = 0.05) +
  theme_modern()
```

However, these **raw means** might be biased, as the number of observations in
each group might be different. Moreover, there might be some hidden covariance or
mediation with other variables in the dataset, creating a "spurious" influence
on the means.

**How can we take these influences into account while calculating means?**

# Marginal Means

Another way of analysing the means is to actually **statistically model them**,
rather than simply describe them as they appear in the data. For instance, we
could fit a simple Bayesian linear regression modelling the relationship between
`Species` and `Sepal.Width`.

Marginal means are basically means extracted from a statistical model, and
represent average of response variable (here, `Sepal.Width`) for each level of
predictor variable (here, `Species`).


```{r}
library(modelbased)

model <- lm(Sepal.Width ~ Species, data = iris)
means <- estimate_means(model)
means
```

Note that the means computed here are not that different than the raw means we
created above. From which we can surmise that there are not many spurious
influences that we need to worry about in the `iris` dataset. But this might not
be the case for your dataset.

We can now add these means, as well as the [**credible interval (CI)**](https://easystats.github.io/bayestestR/articles/credible_interval.html)
representing the uncertainty of the estimation, as an overlay on the previous
plot:

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width, fill = Species)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_jitter2(width = 0.05, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(data = means, aes(y = Mean, group = 1), linewidth = 1) +
  geom_pointrange(
    data = means,
    aes(y = Mean, ymin = CI_low, ymax = CI_high),
    size = 1,
    color = "white"
  ) +
  theme_modern()
```

# Complex Models

The power of marginal means resides in the fact that they can be estimated from
much more complex models. For instance, we could fit a model that takes into
account the interaction with the other variable, `Petal.Width`. The estimated means will be "adjusted" (or will take into
account) for variations of these other components.

```{r}
model <- lm(Sepal.Width ~ Species * Petal.Width, data = iris)
means_complex <- estimate_means(model)

means_complex
```

Now let's plot the marginal means from the simple linear model (shown in white
dots) we saw above and the marginal means from the more complex model (shown in
yellow dots) next to each other, which should help us notice how the adjusted
means change depending on the predictors.

<!-- The following figure is really difficult to make sense of -->
<!-- We need to think of a simpler way to visualize these -->

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width, fill = Species)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_jitter2(width = 0.05, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(data = means, aes(y = Mean, group = 1), linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_pointrange(
    data = means,
    aes(y = Mean, ymin = CI_low, ymax = CI_high),
    size = 1,
    color = "white"
  ) +
  geom_line(data = means_complex, aes(y = Mean, group = 1), linewidth = 1) +
  geom_pointrange(
    data = means_complex,
    aes(y = Mean, ymin = CI_low, ymax = CI_high),
    size = 1,
    color = "orange"
  ) +
  theme_modern()
```

That's interesting! It seems that after adjusting the model for petal
characteristics, the differences between `Species` seems to be even bigger!

**But are these differences "significant"?**

That's where the contrast analysis comes into play! Click [here to read the tutorial on **contrast
analysis**](https://easystats.github.io/modelbased/articles/estimate_contrasts.html).
