\arguments{
\item{model}{A statistical model.}

\item{contrast}{A character vector indicating the name of the variable(s)
for which to compute the contrasts.}

\item{at}{The predictor variable(s) \emph{at} which to evaluate the desired effect
/ mean / contrasts. Other predictors of the model that are not included
here will be collapsed and "averaged" over (the effect will be estimated
across them).}

\item{fixed}{A character vector indicating the names of the predictors to be
"fixed" (i.e., maintained), so that the estimation is made at these values.}

\item{transform}{Is passed to the \code{type} argument in
\code{emmeans::emmeans()}. See
\href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=emmeans/vignettes/transformations.html}{this vignette}. Can be \code{"none"} (default for contrasts), \code{"response"}
(default for means), \code{"mu"}, \code{"unlink"}, \code{"log"}.
\code{"none"} will leave the values on scale of the linear predictors.
\code{"response"} will transform them on scale of the response variable.
Thus for a logistic model, \code{"none"} will give estimations expressed in
log-odds (probabilities on logit scale) and \code{"response"} in terms of
probabilities.}

\item{ci}{Confidence Interval (CI) level. Default to \code{0.95} (\verb{95\%}).}

\item{adjust}{The p-values adjustment method for frequentist multiple
comparisons. Can be one of "holm" (default), "tukey", "hochberg", "hommel",
"bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr" or "none". See the p-value adjustment
section in the \code{emmeans::test} documentation.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed for instance to \code{\link[=visualisation_matrix]{visualisation_matrix()}}.}
}
\value{
A data frame of estimated contrasts.
}
\description{
Run a contrast analysis by estimating the differences between each level of a
factor. See also other related functions such as \code{\link[=estimate_means]{estimate_means()}}
and \code{\link[=estimate_slopes]{estimate_slopes()}}.

\details{
See the \strong{Details} section below, and don't forget to also check out the
\href{https://easystats.github.io/modelbased/articles/estimate_slopes.html}{Vignettes}
and \href{https://easystats.github.io/modelbased/index.html#features}{README examples} for
various examples, tutorials and use cases.

The \code{\link[=estimate_slopes]{estimate_slopes()}}, \code{\link[=estimate_means]{estimate_means()}} and
\code{\link[=estimate_contrasts]{estimate_contrasts()}} functions are forming a group, as they are all based
on \emph{marginal} estimations (estimations based on a model). All three are
also built on the \pkg{emmeans} package, so reading its documentation (for
instance for \code{\link[emmeans:emmeans]{emmeans::emmeans()}} and \code{\link[emmeans:emtrends]{emmeans::emtrends()}}) is recommended
to understand the idea behind these types of procedures.

\itemize{
\item Model-based \strong{predictions} is the basis for all that follows. Indeed,
the first thing to understand is how models can be used to make predictions
(see \code{\link[=estimate_link]{estimate_link()}}). This corresponds to the predicted response (or
"outcome variable") given specific predictor values of the predictors (i.e.,
given a specific data configuration). This is why the concept of \code{\link[=visualisation_matrix]{reference grid()}} is so important for direct predictions.

\item \strong{Marginal "means"}, obtained via \code{\link[=estimate_means]{estimate_means()}}, are an extension
of such predictions, allowing to "average" (collapse) some of the predictors,
to obtain the average response value at a specific predictors configuration.
This is typically used when some of the predictors of interest are factors.
Indeed, the parameters of the model will usually give you the intercept value
and then the "effect" of each factor level (how different it is from the
intercept). Marginal means can be used to directly give you the mean value of
the response variable at all the levels of a factor. Moreover, it can also be
used to control, or average over predictors, which is useful in the case of
multiple predictors with or without interactions.

\item \strong{Marginal contrasts}, obtained via \code{\link[=estimate_contrasts]{estimate_contrasts()}}, are
themselves at extension of marginal means, in that they allow to investigate
the difference (i.e., the contrast) between the marginal means. This is,
again, often used to get all pairwise differences between all levels of a
factor. It works also for continuous predictors, for instance one could also
be interested in whether the difference at two extremes of a continuous
predictor is significant.

\item Finally, \strong{marginal effects}, obtained via \code{\link[=estimate_slopes]{estimate_slopes()}}, are
different in that their focus is not values on the response variable, but the
model's parameters. The idea is to assess the effect of a predictor at a
specific configuration of the other predictors. This is relevant in the case
of interactions or non-linear relationships, when the effect of a predictor
variable changes depending on the other predictors. Moreover, these effects
can also be "averaged" over other predictors, to get for instance the
"general trend" of a predictor over different factor levels.
}

\strong{Example:} let's imagine the following model \code{lm(y ~ condition * x)} where
\code{condition} is a factor with 3 levels A, B and C and \code{x} a continuous
variable (like age for example). One idea is to see how this model performs,
and compare the actual response y to the one predicted by the model (using
\code{\link[=estimate_response]{estimate_response()}}). Another idea is evaluate the average mean at each of
the condition's levels (using \code{\link[=estimate_means]{estimate_means()}}), which can be useful to
visualize them. Another possibility is to evaluate the difference between
these levels (using \code{\link[=estimate_contrasts]{estimate_contrasts()}}). Finally, one could also estimate
the effect of x averaged over all conditions, or instead within each
condition (\code{using [estimate_slopes]}).
