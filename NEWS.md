# modelbased 0.9.0

## Breaking Changes

- Deprecated argument and function names have been removed.

- Argument `fixed` has been removed, as you can fix predictor at certain values
  using the `by` argument.

- Argument `transform` is deprecated. Please use `predict` instead.

- Argument `method` in `estimate_contrasts()` was renamed into `comparison`.

- All `model_*()` alias names have been removed. Use the related `get_*()`
  functions instead.

## Major Changes

- All `estimate_*()` functions get a `predict` argument, which can be used
  to modulate the type of transformation applied to the predictions (i.e. whether
  predictions should be on the response scale, link scale, etc.). It can also
  be used to predict auxiliary (distributional) parameters.

- The `"marginaleffects"` backend for `estimate_means()` is now fully implemented
  and no longer work-in-progress.

- `estimate_contrasts()` gains a `backend` argument. This defaults to `"emmeans"`,
  but can be set to `"marginaleffects"` to use features of that package to estimate
  contrasts and pairwise comparisons.

- `estimate_expectation()` and related functions also get a `by` argument, as
  alternative to create a datagrid for the `data` argument.

- Many functions get a `verbose` argument, to silence warnings and messages.

## Bug fixes

* `estimate_contrasts()` did not calculate contrasts for all levels when the
  predictor of interest was converted to a factor inside the model formula.

* Fixed issue in `estimate_contrasts()` when `comparsison` (formerly: `method`)
  was not `"pairwise"`.

# modelbased 0.8.9

- Fixed issues related to updates of other *easystats* packages.

# modelbased 0.8.6

## Breaking Changes

- The minimum needed R version has been bumped to `3.6`.

# modelbased 0.8.5

- Fixed issues with printing-methods.

- Maintenance release to fix failing tests in CRAN checks.

# modelbased 0.8.1

- Maintenance release to fix failing tests in CRAN checks.

# modelbased 0.8.0

- `visualisation_matrix()` has now become an alias (alternative name) for the [`get_datagrid()`](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/get_datagrid.html) function, which is implemented in the [`insight`](https://easystats.github.io/insight/) package.


# modelbased 0.7.2

- Patch release. This update fixes failing tests after updating the *insight*
  package.

# modelbased 0.7.1

- API changes: `levels` in `estimate_contrasts` has been replaced by `contrast`.
  `levels` and `modulate` are in general aggregated under `at`.

- `estimate_prediction()` deprecated in favour of `estimate_response()`.

- `estimate_expectation()` now has `data=NULL` by default.

# modelbased 0.7.0

- General overhaul of the package.

- Entire refactoring of `visualisation_matrix()`.

- Option of standardizing/unstandardizing predictions, contrasts and means is
  now available via `standardize()` instead of via options.

- Introduction of `model_emmeans()` as a wrapper to easily create `emmeans`
  objects.

- `estimate_smooth()` transformed into `describe_nonlinear()` and made more
  explicit.

# modelbased 0.6.0

- `estimate_link()` now does *not* transform predictions on the response scale
  for GLMs. To keep the previous behaviour, use the new `estimate_relation()`
  instead. This follows a change in how predictions are made internally (which
  now relies on
  [`get_predicted()`](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/get_predicted.html),
  so more details can be found there).

# modelbased 0.5.1

- Minor improvements.

# modelbased 0.3.0

## Breaking changes

- `Predicted` is now the name of the predicted column for Bayesian models
  (similarly to Frequentist ones), instead of the centrality index (e.g.,
  `Median`).

## New supported models

- Models from package *glmmTMB* are now supported.

## Bug fixes

- `estimate_slope()` now gives an informative error when no numeric predictor is
  present.

# modelbased 0.2.0

- Partial support of formulas.

- Refactor the emmeans wrapping.

# modelbased 0.1.3

- Fix CRAN check issues.

# modelbased 0.1.2

- Minor code changes to address changes from the forthcoming `parameters`
  package update.

# modelbased 0.1.1

- Fix CRAN check issues.

# modelbased 0.1.0

- Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package
